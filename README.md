# AB-Portfolio
#Project Structure
I created the core files and folders in the appropriate files and folder
to make the code easier to maintain.
I gathered all the necessary images and placed them in their folders

#Content
I then started by adding all the relevant content to the index.html.
I added the header, links, the various sections and all the content
I added them in the correct html structure

#CSS
After deciding on the theme I started working on the css, starting with the header
I added the styling to make the website look modern and informative.
After each section was done I moved to the next section as I moved towards the bottom
and finally finished with the footer.

#Device compatibility
This was the final stage.
I started with adding a menu button when the screen gets too small.
The links form a column and appear and disappear according to the
menu button click
I then moved to the banner tag line and made sure the content did
not overflow when the screen got too small
Lastly I worked on the content where I placed the titles on top for better clarity
and readability.
